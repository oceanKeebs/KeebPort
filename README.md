# KeebPort

Keeb Port is a split keyboard architecture with a central part housing a micro controller and 6 keys (two keys can be replaced with encoders optionally). Right and left part of the split keyboard do not include a micro controller but an IO expander (MCP23017) processing the key activation information and connected via i2c to the central part. The LED control signal is generated by the micro controller and provided via a separate line to both split keyboard parts. Central and split keyboard parts are connected with TRRRS (5-pin). All layouts share the same firmware.
